# What are the 2 types of routing?

There are two types of routing in web development:

1. **Client-side routing**: This type of routing is handled on the client side, typically using JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue. It allows for dynamic updates to the content without requiring a full page reload.

2. **Server-side routing**: This type of routing is handled on the server side. When a user requests a URL, the server processes the request and sends back the appropriate HTML content. This is the traditional way of handling routing on the web.
